According to the <i>American Stampless Cover Catalog</i>, no covers are known from this first period. The earliest recorded letter from Florida was datelined \"Exiled Pensacola September 5, 1763\" but was carried privately and has no postal markings. The cover offered here is the earliest known used from Florida carried in the mails with a postmark.</p><p>Described in <i>American Stampless Cover Catalog</i> on p. 48. Ex Dr. Briggs</p>",

* EasternAuctions :
----------------
For Eastern Auctions, can you do a Sample for $100. I would pay $300 for a new version of the Scraper for Easter Auctions. 
You can make separate programs for each auction company to keep it simple. On the Eastern, please try to see if you can determine the catalog number. 
I will need the Country, Catalog Number, Description, Image, Sale Date, and Price Sold. If there is JSON to inspect that gives us other information, let me know.
